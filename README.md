## I-SmartMap
This project is a map of the Mazak I-SmartFactory. The intention of this map is to help people navagate the factory and locate SmartBoxes. There are also some administrative features to help keep everything in one place.

The site will provide
*A 2D graphic of the FMF with panning and zoom capabilities
*Interactable SMB locations
*Selectors for displaying details concerning SmartBox and MTConnect.
